        <h2>Changelog</h2>
        <h3>v1â€”May 2016</h3>
        <p>
          First The Bullpenâ„¢ was started for those sitting in the bullpen area
          of the old office.
        </p>
        <h3>v2â€”May 2017</h3>
        <p>
          Dave left and Lance was made the admin for the room, so we couldn't
          make changes or add new people (without talking to Lance, which Nate
          was too afraid to do). A new public The Bullpen room was created to
          avoid this issue in the future, and the original was abandoned.
        </p>
        <h3>v3â€”October 2017</h3>
        <p>Simplifile moved into the new office.</p>
        <h3>v4â€”December 2018</h3>
        <p>The great seat reshuffling in preparation for new interns.</p>
        <h3>v5â€”January 2019</h3>
        <p>Simplifile switched from HipChat to SlackðŸŽ‰</p>
        <h3>v10â€”2019</h3>
        <p>
          Various reshufflings around people coming and going due to school and
          changes in departments.
        </p>
        <h3>v11â€”July 2020</h3>
        <p>
          Simplifile switched from Slack to Microsoft Teams as part of the ICE
          merger process.
        </p>
        <h3>v11.1â€”August 2020</h3>
        <p>
          Lance deletes the previous The Bullpenâ„¢ because channels need to be
          <q>business specific, so no personal or hobby-type Channels</q> ðŸ˜¢.
          It's converted to a group chat in Teams, but it's probably not long
          lived since it still falls under ICE's 7-year data retention policies.
